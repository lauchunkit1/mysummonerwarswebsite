    <h3>Guild Battles</h3>
<p><h4>Players can participate in guild wars where the player can set defences consisting of two teams with three monsters each. Guilds battle randomly select guilds of similar ranking to earn points. Players are also able to participate in a siege battle, a 3-guild free for all with the goal of occupying the enemy guild's bases to gain more points. The first guild to reach 20,000 points wins the battle. If a guild is unable to reach the 20,000 points before the timer runs out, the guild with the most siege points win.</h4>
    <h3>World Arena</h3>
<p><h4>The World Arena is where players face off against other players in real time (by default, up to 30 times a day). The two players take turns selecting a team of five monsters, with no duplicates allowed. After both teams are selected, each player bans one monster on the opposing team, and the match begins. The battle concludes when either player eliminates all monsters from the opposing team. The winner receives Victory Points and Medals according to their rank, while the loser suffers a small Victory Point deduction.
    World Arena also includes a Goodwill Battle mode, which is unranked, and allows players to battle friends or other players as often as they wish. Additionally, players may view replays of their and other players' past battles or watch battles in progress via Spectator mode.
